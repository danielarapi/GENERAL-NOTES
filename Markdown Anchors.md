### How to create anchors from markdown header
1. All text is converted to lowercase
2. All non-word text (e.g., punctuation, HTML) is removed
3. All spaces are converted to hyphens
4. Two or more hyphens in a row are converted to one
6. If a header with the same ID has already been generated, a unique incrementing number is appended, starting at 1.
